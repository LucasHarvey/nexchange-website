            <h2>Preserves Anonymity</h2>
            <p>Our software allows students with learning difficulties to remain anonymous to their notetaker. Nexchange eliminates the need for a third party
               to transfer notes from the notetaker to the student in need of notes.

            <h2>Mobile-Friendly</h2>
            <p>The Nexchange platform is mobile-friendly, which allows students receiving notes and notetakers to upload or download notes without scanning them
               or transferring files to their computer.</p>

            <h2>User Analytics</h2>
            <p>The student accessibility center can easily analyze user activity using the administrator panel. This is useful to determine how much notetakers should
               be remunerated and to determine if students with learning difficulties are using the service.

            <h2>Archive of Notes</h2>
            <p>The amount of notes increases every year, therefore creating an archive of notes. If a notetaker cannot be found for a given class where a student
               needs help, the accessibility center can grant access to a past iteration of a course.

            <h2>Notifications</h2>
            <p>Students receiving notes can choose to be notified through email when new notes are uploaded. Notetakers will be notified if they have not
               posted notes within a certain amount of hours since their last class.

               looking for with ease.
