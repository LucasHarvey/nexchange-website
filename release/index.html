      <h1>OUR SOFTWARE</h1>
      <p>Our note exchange platform aims to help students with learning difficulties by providing them with seamless access to class notes.
        Our mobile-friendly software allows note takers to easily take pictures of their notes and upload them to the platform, where the student receiving the
        notes can view them.

      <h1>TESTIMONIALS</h1>
      <p>
        "I would rate it a 10/10 for note sharing because it has a clean and clear interface.
        Also, the steps to uploading notes is super simple and everything you need is really easy to find with the tabs at the top of the screen."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Thus far, I would rate my overall satisfaction with the Nexchange system as a 10.
        I have not experienced a single bug with the system since I have started using it and I have been receiving all my notes without any complications.
        In comparison to the email-based system used in parallel with Nexchange, Nexchange is easy to use and much more efficient in that all your notes are grouped into one system and are easily accessible.
      </p>
      <p>
        "All the notes are divided under their respective classes and can be configured to be sorted in different ways.
        You are also notified when new notes are uploaded and can even choose to turn off these notifications should you desire it, whereas that is not an option via the email-based system."
