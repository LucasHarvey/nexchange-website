      <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
      <p>Nexchange was created within the Sandbox, an entrepreneurship hub at John Abbott College. What started as the idea for an online platform to exchange notes evolved into a fully developed product that makes a difference
         in the lives of students with learning difficulties. Nexchange has won both the local and regional levels of the <a href="www.osentreprendre.quebec/en/">OSEntreprendre</a> competition and is now competing at the provincial stage.

      <h1 id="founder_name">Lucas Harvey</h1>
      <p id="title">Founder & CEO</p>
      <p>As a student that strives for the highest degree of excellence, Lucas wanted to combine his technological skills
         and academic distinction. Lucas leads Nexchange with the mindset that students should have access to customized educational tools that will
         lower their stress levels and make their journey through education as smooth as possible.
