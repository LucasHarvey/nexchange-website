      <h1>OUR SOFTWARE</h1>
      <p>Our note exchange platform aims to help students with learning difficulties by providing them with seamless access to class notes.
        Our mobile-friendly software allows note takers to easily take pictures of their notes and upload them to the platform, where the student receiving the
        notes can view them.

      <h1>TESTIMONIALS</h1>
      <p>
        "I would rate it a 10/10 for note sharing because it has a clean and clear interface.
        Also, the steps to uploading notes is super simple and everything you need is really easy to find."
      </p>
      <p class="line"></p>
      <p>
        "Thus far, I would rate my overall satisfaction with the Nexchange system as a 10. I have not experienced a single bug with the system since I have started using it and I have been receiving all my notes without any complications."
      </p>
      <p class="line"></p>
      <p>
        "In comparison to the email-based system, Nexchange is easy to use and much more efficient in that all your notes are grouped into one system and are easily accessible."
